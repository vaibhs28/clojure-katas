  Reference: SICP
  How many different ways can we make change of $1.00, given half-dollars, quarters, nickels, and pennies?
  More generally, can we write a procedure to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of money?

  Solution 1 build tree recursion
  # of ways to change amount a using n kinds of coins =
    # of ways to change amount a using all but first kind of coin +
    # of ways to change amount a - d, where d is the denomination of the first kind of coin"
  [amount, index-of-coin-change-array]
 (cond
    (= amount 0) 1
    (< amount 0) 0
    (< index-of-coin-change-array 0) 0
    :else (+ (count-coin-change-tree amount (dec index-of-coin-change-array)) 
                                     (count-coin-change-tree (- amount (get coins index-of-coin-change-array)) index-of-coin-change-array)))
